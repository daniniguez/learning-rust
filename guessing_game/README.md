# Guessing Game

This is a beginner programming programing problem: a guessing game. The program
will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will them prompt the
player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate
whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game
will print a congratulatory message and exit.
